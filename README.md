## How to Play
1. Click the "Deal" button to start a new round.
2. You will be dealt two cards face up, and the dealer will also receive two cards, one face up and one face down.
3. Choose whether to "Hit" (receive another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand).
4. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting).
5. Once you're satisfied with your hand, click "Stand" to end your turn.
6. The dealer will reveal their face-down card and draw additional cards until their total is 17 or higher.
7. If your total is higher than the dealer's total (without busting), you win! If not, the dealer wins.
8. Keep playing rounds to improve your Blackjack skills and beat the dealer.
